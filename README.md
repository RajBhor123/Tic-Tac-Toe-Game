# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Developed a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Implemented game logic for two-player mode, interactive UI design, and responsive layout to enhance userÂ experience.

The Tic Tac Toe game is a fully functional web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game supports a two-player mode, where players take turns marking their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. Key features and functionality include:

Game Logic:
The game implements robust logic to detect winning conditions, such as completing a row, column, or diagonal with the same symbol. Additionally, a draw case is accounted for, ensuring that when the grid is completely filled without a winner, the game ends with a "Draw" notification.

Interactive UI Design:

The user interface is designed to provide immediate feedback, such as highlighting winning rows, columns, or diagonals.
Intuitive controls make it easy for players to take turns.
Responsive Layout:
The design adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Draw Case Handling:
If all grid cells are occupied and no player has met the winning condition, the game declares a Draw. This ensures fairness and completeness in the gameplay.
